# Sprint 1 execution results — updated 2026-07-24 (Telegram lane)

**Commits:** `6d759c5` / `cec86c2` / **`94dd562`** (commerce paid-download path)  
**Live:** https://bvsradio.com  
**SQL:** packs 01–08 applied by Abias on project `rdwwyolrxahimcgpkzzy` (verified play **204**)

| # | Outcome | Status | Evidence |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Dirty-tree integrate | **Done** | 56 files on `main` |
| 2 | Schema + auth roles | **Done enough** | Packs 1–8 applied; play RPC **204**; auth pages no localhost. Multi-role matrix not fully automated. |
| 3 | FAQ + WIP ship | **Done** | `/faq` **200**; ThemeToggle; nav/footer |
| 4 | Player like/shuffle/repeat/recovery | **Done** | Live controls verified (WhatsApp lane also touched StationPlayer 2026-07-24) |
| 5 | Payment → download | **Code shipped; prod proof blocked** | `94dd562`: orders load/update via Supabase; webhooks + `/api/download` use it. Local token+paid order+MP3 **OK** (`ops/qa/last-paid-download-local.json`). Live create_order from VPS returned **403 Vercel challenge** — need browser/sandbox pass after deploy Ready. |
| 6 | Monitoring + errors | **Done** | Synthetic OK + cron; ClientErrorBeacon |
| 7 | Submit→approve→rotation→playcount | **Mostly (user tested submit)** | Abias: **submission test as bvsadmin**. Play tracking RPC works. Full chain still: confirm editorial saw it → approve/publish/rotation → play_count increments in studio. |

## Collision note (2026-07-24 ~16:10–16:20 Berlin)

- WhatsApp agent session `80b211c6…` was active on **StationPlayer / catalogue** (browser + apply_patch + build/commit).
- Telegram lane **did not edit** `StationPlayer.tsx`; owned commerce #5 only.
- WhatsApp commit seen on main: `eda21ae fix(player): make catalogue audio claim unconditional`.

## What Abias closed

- SQL packs 1–8 in Supabase SQL Editor  
- Submission test with **bvsadmin** (submit leg of #7)

## Still open

1. **#5 live proof** — after Vercel Ready + no challenge: run `node scripts/commerce-paid-download-proof.mjs` (or one real Stripe test card).
2. **#7 tail** — editorial approve + rotation + play_count if not already done in bvsadmin test.
3. **Ops unlock** — still **missing** `~/.openclaw/secrets/bvs-supabase-db.env` (`DATABASE_URL`). Only `.example` present. One-time Abias paste of DB URI unlocks agent SQL apply/verify.

## Synthetic (last recheck)

Home/radio/catalogue/faq/checkout/manifest/sw + audio range 206 — OK (earlier).  
2026-07-24 afternoon: direct VPS curls to bvsradio.com hit **Vercel Security Checkpoint 403** — do not treat as product down without browser check.
